# Benchmark
Benchmarking Bun, Node and Deno [frameworks](/src) performance, in requests per second.

You can see the details results [here](/results/index.md). 

I recommend testing this by yourself as performance may varies on different machine.

## Requirements
All tool required to set up and run the benchmark.

### Bun
Bun is required to run the Bun server, Bun frameworks and benchmark scripts. See [bun.sh](https://bun.sh).

### Node
Node is required to run the Node server. See [nodejs.dev](https://nodejs.dev).

### Deno
Deno is required to run the Deno server. See [deno.land](https://deno.land).

### Bombardier
Go is required to install the `bombardier` CLI. See [go.dev](https://go.dev).
Install `bombardier` using:
```bash
# Install the CLI without a `go.mod` file
go install -mod=mod github.com/codesenberg/bombardier

# Check after install
bombardier --version
```
You need to manually set `GO_PATH` to your extracted `go` directory, `GO_BIN` to `$GO_PATH/bin` and add `GO_BIN` to `PATH` if `bombardier --version` fails.

## Start
Clone this reposity. Go to the root directory and run:
```bash
# Install required dependencies
bun ins

# Run the benchmark
bun bench

# Or do both
bun start
```

## Configurations
See [configuration file](/config.ts) and the [type declarations](/lib/types.ts).
